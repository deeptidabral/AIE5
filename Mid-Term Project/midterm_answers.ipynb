    "<b> ANSWER:  </b> \n",
    "For digital-savvy, upwardly mobile but budget-conscious travelers, planning a trip is often a frustrating and time-consuming experience. While they rely on online itinerary planners from platforms like Expedia, these tools primarily serve as vendor-driven marketplaces rather than objective travel advisors. The search results and recommendations are often skewed by sponsored listings, pushing specific hotels, flights, and experiences that may not align with the traveler’s true preferences or budget. As a result, users are left sifting through an overwhelming volume of content, struggling to distinguish between genuine value and paid promotions, leading to decision fatigue and a suboptimal travel experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, these travelers face FOMO due to the sheer influx of content across social media and travel websites, making it difficult to determine what is truly worth experiencing. Existing tools provide generic information but fail to give real-time, contextual insights into destinations—such as actual crowd levels, local weather conditions, or a location's current vibe—leaving travelers unsure if their chosen spots will match their expectations. Budget-conscious users also find it hard to get a realistic estimate of their total trip costs, as expenses like local transportation, food, and hidden fees are often not factored into standard itinerary planners. This lack of transparency and personalization results in frustration, unnecessary expenses, and missed opportunities to optimize their travel experience.  \n",

    "The solution is a next-generation AI travel assistant powered by a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) + multi-agent system architecture that aggregates, analyzes, and personalizes travel information from diverse sources. Unlike traditional itinerary planners that primarily serve vendor interests, this AI assistant will act as an unbiased, intelligent advisor, helping users discover destinations, build optimized itineraries, and make data-driven travel decisions based on their unique preferences, constraints, and real-time conditions.\n",

    "The system will leverage multi-agent coordination to collect and process data from multiple sources, including real-time weather reports, footfall density analysis, cost estimations, and user-generated reviews. Using vector embeddings and a scalable knowledge base, the assistant will provide hyper-personalized recommendations, avoiding the noise of paid promotions and instead focusing on authentic, data-backed insights. It will predict potential trip expenses based on dynamic pricing trends and offer realistic previews of destinations—including expected crowd levels, atmosphere, and local conditions—ensuring users make informed choices. By eliminating information overload and uncertainty, this AI assistant will help budget-conscious travelers maximize their experience while staying within their financial limits.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b> ANSWER:  </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "The default chunking strategy you're using is the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunk size of 4000 characters - This is significantly larger than typical chunk sizes (often around 1000-1500 characters), which suggests you're optimizing for context preservation within chunks.  \n",
    "2. Chunk overlap of 400 characters (10%) - This creates a 10% overlap between adjacent chunks to maintain continuity and context across chunk boundaries.  \n",
    "3. Multiple separators in hierarchical order (\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\") - This ensures the splitting happens at natural text boundaries whenever possible, preserving semantic coherence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This chunking strategy is appropriate for RAGAS for several reasons:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluation needs: RAGAS measures retrieval quality, faithfulness, and context relevance - all of which benefit from larger chunks that preserve more context.  \n",
    "2. Semantic coherence: Larger chunks are more likely to contain complete thoughts, arguments, or explanations, making it easier for the LLM to understand and utilize the information.  \n",
    "3. Reducing fragmentation: With larger chunks, you reduce the risk of important contextual relationships being broken across chunk boundaries.  \n",
    "4. Balancing retrieval granularity with context: The 4000-character size strikes a balance between having chunks small enough for precise retrieval but large enough to maintain sufficient context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The comment \"Larger chunks for RAGAS\" in your code suggests this decision was made specifically for evaluation purposes, which makes sense since RAGAS metrics often perform better when evaluating larger, more contextually complete chunks.  \n",

    "Faithfulness (26%) is higher than the overall system but still low.  \n",

    "Context Precision (96%) is excellent, suggesting high accuracy in retrieved information.\n",
    "Context Recall (67%) is moderate.\n",

    "(b) Itinerary Agent\n",
    "Faithfulness (9%) is the lowest among all sub-agents, meaning it generates highly inaccurate responses.\n",

    "Context Precision (96%) is excellent.\n",
    "Context Recall (68%) is moderate.\n",
