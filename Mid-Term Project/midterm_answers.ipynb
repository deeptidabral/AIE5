    "<b> 1. Lack of unbiased, genuine source of information</b> : For digital-savvy, upwardly mobile but budget-conscious traveler segment, planning a trip can be frustrating and time-consuming. While there are popular online itinerary planners from industry leaders such as Expedia, these tools primarily serve as vendor-driven marketplaces rather than objective travel advisory. The search results and recommendations are often skewed by sponsored listings, pushing specific hotels, flights, and experiences that may or may not optimize for travelers' interests. Thus, users are left with the option of browsing through an overwhelming volume of content themselves.\n",

    "<b> 2. Decision fatigue and suboptimal travel experience</b> : Travelers, despite hyper connectivity, face FOMO (fear of missing out) due to the sheer influx of content across social media and travel websites, making it difficult to determine what is truly worth experiencing. Existing tools provide generic information but fail to give real-time, contextual insights into destinations—such as actual crowd levels, local weather conditions, or a location's current vibe. Thus, there is a lot of uncertainty about whether their chosen spots will match their expectations. Price sensitive groups also find it hard to get a realistic estimate of their total trip costs. \n",

    "The solution is a next-generation AI travel assistant powered by a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) + multi-agent system architecture that aggregates, analyzes, and personalizes travel information from diverse sources. Unlike traditional itinerary planners that primarily serve vendor interests, this AI assistant will act as an unbiased, intelligent advisor, helping users discover destinations, build optimized itineraries, and make data-driven travel decisions based on their unique preferences, constraints, and real-time conditions.\n",

    "In the next sprint, I want to make the following key improvements to enhance the AI travel assistant to enhance its accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Expand Data Sources to 10+ </b> – Currently, the system relies on a two data sources (1 external API and 1 public online travel guide). I will integrate additional structured and unstructured data sources, including government tourism APIs, local transit systems, and real-time pricing aggregators, to provide more comprehensive and unbiased travel insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Improve Model Performance </b> – By optimizing prompt engineering, retrieval strategies, and response formatting, I intend to enhance the faithfulness, accuracy and contextual relevance of AI-generated travel recommendations. This is meaningful direction from the analysis of the system performance tabulated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Fine-tune LLM on Targeted Parameters </b>– While the current setup uses a general-purpose LLM, I will conduct larger-scale fine-tuning iterations, focusing on travel itinerary structuring, and user preference adaptation. I hope this will improve the model’s ability to generate more precise outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Expand Synthetic Dataset for Agent Testing </b>– To ensure robust agent interactions, I will increase the size and diversity of synthetic datasets used for testing. This will help in larger stress-testing of the agent system leading to better generalization in real-world use cases.\n",
