- source_sentence: 'QUESTION #1\n'
  sentences:
  - 'Google’s NotebookLM, released in September, took audio output to a new level
    by producing spookily realistic conversations between two “podcast hosts” about
    anything you fed into their tool. They later added custom instructions, so naturally
    I turned them into pelicans:


    The most recent twist, again from December (December was a lot) is live video.
    ChatGPT voice mode now provides the option to share your camera feed with the
    model and talk about what you can see in real time. Google Gemini have a preview
    of the same feature, which they managed to ship the day before ChatGPT did.'
  - 'Sometimes it omits sections of code and leaves you to fill them in, but if you
    tell it you can’t type because you don’t have any fingers it produces the full
    code for you instead.


    There are so many more examples like this. Offer it cash tips for better answers.
    Tell it your career depends on it. Give it positive reinforcement. It’s all so
    dumb, but it works!


    Gullibility is the biggest unsolved problem


    I coined the term prompt injection in September last year.


    15 months later, I regret to say that we’re still no closer to a robust, dependable
    solution to this problem.


    I’ve written a ton about this already.


    Beyond that specific class of security vulnerabilities, I’ve started seeing this
    as a wider problem of gullibility.'
  - 'Law is not ethics. Is it OK to train models on people’s content without their
    permission, when those models will then be used in ways that compete with those
    people?


    As the quality of results produced by AI models has increased over the year, these
    questions have become even more pressing.


    The impact on human society in terms of these models is already huge, if difficult
    to objectively measure.


    People have certainly lost work to them—anecdotally, I’ve seen this for copywriters,
    artists and translators.


    There are a great deal of untold stories here. I’m hoping 2024 sees significant
    amounts of dedicated journalism on this topic.


    My blog in 2023'
- source_sentence: 'QUESTION #1\n'
  sentences:
  - 'I’ve found myself using this a lot. I noticed how much I was relying on it in
    October and wrote Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week, describing
    14 little tools I had put together in a seven day period.


    Since then, a whole bunch of other teams have built similar systems. GitHub announced
    their version of this—GitHub Spark—in October. Mistral Chat added it as a feature
    called Canvas in November.


    Steve Krouse from Val Town built a version of it against Cerebras, showcasing
    how a 2,000 token/second LLM can iterate on an application with changes visible
    in less than a second.'
  - 'We already knew LLMs were spookily good at writing code. If you prompt them right,
    it turns out they can build you a full interactive application using HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript (and tools like React if you wire up some extra supporting build
    mechanisms)—often in a single prompt.


    Anthropic kicked this idea into high gear when they released Claude Artifacts,
    a groundbreaking new feature that was initially slightly lost in the noise due
    to being described half way through their announcement of the incredible Claude
    3.5 Sonnet.


    With Artifacts, Claude can write you an on-demand interactive application and
    then let you use it directly inside the Claude interface.


    Here’s my Extract URLs app, entirely generated by Claude:'
  - 'Prompt injection is a natural consequence of this gulibility. I’ve seen precious
    little progress on tackling that problem in 2024, and we’ve been talking about
    it since September 2022.


    I’m beginning to see the most popular idea of “agents” as dependent on AGI itself.
    A model that’s robust against gulliblity is a very tall order indeed.


    Evals really matter


    Anthropic’s Amanda Askell (responsible for much of the work behind Claude’s Character):


    The boring yet crucial secret behind good system prompts is test-driven development.
    You don’t write down a system prompt and find ways to test it. You write down
    tests and find a system prompt that passes them.'
- source_sentence: 'QUESTION #2\n...\n\nContext:\nOpenAI made GPT-4o free for all
    users in May, and Claude'
  sentences:
  - 'This remains astonishing to me. I thought a model with the capabilities and output
    quality of GPT-4 needed a datacenter class server with one or more $40,000+ GPUs.


    These models take up enough of my 64GB of RAM that I don’t run them often—they
    don’t leave much room for anything else.


    The fact that they run at all is a testament to the incredible training and inference
    performance gains that we’ve figured out over the past year. It turns out there
    was a lot of low-hanging fruit to be harvested in terms of model efficiency. I
    expect there’s still more to come.'
  - 'OpenAI made GPT-4o free for all users in May, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet was freely
    available from its launch in June. This was a momentus change, because for the
    previous year free users had mostly been restricted to GPT-3.5 level models, meaning
    new users got a very inaccurate mental model of what a capable LLM could actually
    do.


    That era appears to have ended, likely permanently, with OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT
    Pro. This $200/month subscription service is the only way to access their most
    capable model, o1 Pro.'
  - 'OpenAI are not the only game in town here. Google released their first entrant
    in the category, gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp, on December 19th.


    Alibaba’s Qwen team released their QwQ model on November 28th—under an Apache
    2.0 license, and that one I could run on my own machine. They followed that up
    with a vision reasoning model called QvQ on December 24th, which I also ran locally.


    DeepSeek made their DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview model available to try out through
    their chat interface on November 20th.


    To understand more about inference scaling I recommend Is AI progress slowing
    down? by Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor.'
- source_sentence: 'QUESTION #2\n...\n\nContext:\nThese abilities are just a few weeks
    old at this point, and I don’t think their impact has been fully felt yet. If
    you haven’t tried them out yet you really should.\n\nBoth Gemini and OpenAI offer
    API access to these features as well. OpenAI started with a WebSocket API that
    was quite challenging to use, but in December they announced a new WebRTC API
    which is much easier to get started with. Building a web app that a user can talk
    to via voice is easy now!\n\nPrompt driven app generation is a commodity already\n\nThis
    was possible with GPT-4 in 2023, but the value it provides became evident in'
  sentences:
  - 'On the other hand, as software engineers we are better placed to take advantage
    of this than anyone else. We’ve all been given weird coding interns—we can use
    our deep knowledge to prompt them to solve coding problems more effectively than
    anyone else can.


    The ethics of this space remain diabolically complex


    In September last year Andy Baio and I produced the first major story on the unlicensed
    training data behind Stable Diffusion.


    Since then, almost every major LLM (and most of the image generation models) have
    also been trained on unlicensed data.'
  - 'The environmental impact got much, much worse


    The much bigger problem here is the enormous competitive buildout of the infrastructure
    that is imagined to be necessary for these models in the future.


    Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon are all spending billions of
    dollars rolling out new datacenters, with a very material impact on the electricity
    grid and the environment. There’s even talk of spinning up new nuclear power stations,
    but those can take decades.'
  - 'These abilities are just a few weeks old at this point, and I don’t think their

  - 'Longer inputs dramatically increase the scope of problems that can be solved
    with an LLM: you can now throw in an entire book and ask questions about its contents,
    but more importantly you can feed in a lot of example code to help the model correctly
    solve a coding problem. LLM use-cases that involve long inputs are far more interesting
    to me than short prompts that rely purely on the information already baked into
    the model weights. Many of my tools were built using this pattern.'
